# Chive

## What is Chive?

Chive is an online, computer-vision (CV) pipeline editor that will provide a sleek UI to help speedup the CV pipeline iteration process. The goal is to make a graphical editor with drag-and-drop capabilities, allowing you to modify and add CV nodes/edges and see the resulting effect on input images in real time. Eventually, there will be a codegen feature, allowing you to export your pipeline directly as a C++ or Python OpenCV function.
